# Spring-Thymeleaf
This is a project inspired by a course for educational purposes on my journey to learn about Spring-Boot. Using HTML with Thymeleaf and Java with Spring-Boot, a pseudo-website was created to register students, with some information. The original code was made by Jamerson Souza. This is my first Spring project and not responsive.
